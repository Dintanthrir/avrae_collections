# Behold, _My Stuff_

Have you ever been frustrated by items without automations? Have you been copying and pasting automations for your homebrew items? Want a way to share your automations with an entire server?

[My Stuff](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/6457dd6989cf5c4607d3b4e9) is a tool for adding and removing counters and automations from your characters.

`!stuff list`
> **Items (Basic Rules)**
> 
> Acid
> 
> Alchemist's Fire
> 
> Ball Bearings
> 
> ...

`!stuff equip -group basic -item alchemist` adds automations for Alchemist's Fire to the current character.

My Stuff is built to support your homebrew. Add your own collections of item automations to a cvar, uvar, or svar and share them across your characters or with your server.
