        must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage
        and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its
        movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A
        creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself
        or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1
        piercing damage to the trapped creature.
