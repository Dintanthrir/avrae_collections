Discards your current crafting.

If you have `setup` a crafting project but not started it `discard` will clear your active project and you will not have paid for the materials or used your downtime.

If you have started crafting you will not be refunded the materials cost paid during your first crafting check and your downtime timer will remain unchanged.

You can `setup` a new crafting project immediately after `discard`ing an old one but may need to wait for your downtime to be available again before you can make your first crafting check.
