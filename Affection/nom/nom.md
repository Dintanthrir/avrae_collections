Posts a nom embed with a random image.
```
!nom [recipient or phrase]
```

A customized name can be stored in a `hugname` uvar for compatibility with https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/5f76270e4ded026d119cf937. It can be overridden with a cvar if you want it to change with your active character.
```
!uvar hugname <your preferred name>
```
Delete these variables to clear any set name and return to using your current Discord display name.
```
!uvar remove hugname
```
