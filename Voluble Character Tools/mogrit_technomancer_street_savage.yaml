                0₵ 2d6 slashing - lb. Automatic, heavy, reload (30, action), special, two-handed

                **Automatic.** When you take the Attack action, you can choose to make an additional weapon attack for each attack you make with an automatic weapon this turn. Until the end of your turn, all attacks made with automatic weapons are made with disadvantage, and advantage cannot affect the roll. When making use of the automatic property, you can only attack at half of the normal range of the weapon. When a creature that is Medium size or smaller uses the automatic weapon property on a weapon, melee attacks have advantage against them until the start of their next turn. You can't use this property in the same turn you've used the burst-fire weapon property. You can make no more than four additional attacks in this manner in a single turn.

                **Chainsaw.** While running, it constantly makes a loud noise. It has the automatic property from firearm properties, but the weapon's range is unchanged when using the property. It also has the reload (30, action) property from firearm properties, the weapon must be loaded with fuel (see “Ammunition”) to function, and each attack made with the weapon consumes 1 fuel.

                **Savage Accessory.** This weapon also functions as a chainsaw for melee attack purposes, including opportunity attacks, except that it does not require a pull start in order to be used.

                a target. It functions similarly to a spear gun except that it is

                this weapon, and the target is a creature your size or smaller,
                you can make a contested Strength (Athletics) check to pull it
                next to you and grapple it with a free hand. If there is no
                open adjacent space, then the creature stops in the nearest
                available open space and is not grappled. Alternatively, if the
                target is larger than you, you can choose to be pulled to it.
                However, this does not grapple it.
