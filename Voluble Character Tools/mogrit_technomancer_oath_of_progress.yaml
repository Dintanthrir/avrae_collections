                You can use your Channel Divinity
                to captivate your fellow people with your presence. As an
                action, you force each creature of your choice that you can
                see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On
                a failed save, a creature becomes charmed for 10 minutes.
                The charmed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, and
                can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns if
                it sees a hostile creature, ending the effect on itself on a
                success. The effect ends for a creature if you damage it.

                You can use your Channel Divinity to
                gamble on a powerful blow. When you would hit with a
                weapon attack, you can instead use your Channel Divinity to
                make the attack again, ignoring advantage and disadvantage
                on the roll. If the attack still hits, it is a critical hit.

                When you hit another creature with a weapon
                attack, you can cause it to make a Charisma saving throw. On
                a failed save, the creature is cursed for 1 minute. Add 1d4 to
                attack rolls against the cursed creature, and the cursed
                creature subtracts 1d4 from its saving throws.
                You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
                Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all
                expended uses when you finish a long rest.
                Additionally, your Divine Sense feature can detect
                creatures that can speak at least one language, and you know
                what languages they speak.

                your force of personality is strong enough to
                spark an unbreakable alliance. As an action, you can become
                an unstoppable icon, gaining the following benefits for 1
                minute:
                - Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you deals an
                extra 1d6 force damage when it hits with an attack.
                - When a creature other than yourself that you can see
                within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points as a result of
                taking damage, but is not killed outright, you can use your
                reaction to drop it to 1 hit point instead.
                - You and creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you can
                ignore difficult terrain.
                Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
                finish a long rest.
