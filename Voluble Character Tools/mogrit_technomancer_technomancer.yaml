                When you make a hacking tools check, you can use
                your reaction to make it with advantage.

                As a bonus action, you choose a point you can
                see within 150 feet of you. All electrical light sources within
                80 feet of that point cease to function for 1 minute. If a
                creature is carrying the light source, it can make an
                Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the light
                source is unaffected.

                When a trap that you are aware of based on
                technology or magic is triggered within 60 feet of you, you
                can use your reaction to disable the trap for 1 minute. A trap,
                for the purpose of this ability, includes anything that would
                inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or
                undesirable. Thus, this ability would disable a security
                camera, a laser tripwire, or a glyph of warding, but not a
                camouflaged pitfall or a hunting trap.

                As an action, you cause a creature you are aware of
                in the same network as you to make an Intelligence saving
                throw. On a failed save, they are ejected from the network
                and cannot re-enter it for 24 hours.
                Alternatively, as an action, you can target an AI-controlled
                drone or vehicle you can see within 60 feet of you, forcing the
                AI to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the
                AI loses control over the drone or vehicle for 24 hours.

                As a bonus action, you can force a vehicle within
                60 feet of you that you can see to make a Constitution saving
                throw. On a failed save, at the start of the driver’s next turn
                the vehicle must move up to its movement speed in a straight
                line in a direction of your choice. If the vehicle has no driver,
                it does so on initiative count 0.

                As a bonus action, you cause a firearm within 60 feet
                of you that you can see to malfunction. When a creature
                makes an attack with that firearm within 1 minute, the
                creature must roll a d8 and subtract the number rolled from
                the attack roll. If a creature is holding the firearm, it makes
                an Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the
                firearm is unaffected.

                As a bonus action, you choose a vehicle within
                30 feet of you. For 1 minute, whenever the vehicle makes an
                attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, it can roll a d4
                and add the number rolled to the result.
                Alternatively, when a vehicle makes an attack roll, a saving
                throw, or an ability check within 30 feet of you, you use your
                reaction to grant advantage to that roll.

                As a bonus action, you reduce a Small or
                smaller machine within 60 feet of you that you can see to 0
                hit points and cause targets within 5 feet of it to take
                lightning damage equal to half your wizard level. The
                machine cannot be a weapon. If a creature is carrying the
                machine, it can make an Intelligence saving throw. On a
                successful save, the machine is unaffected.

                As an action, you cause an EMP at a point you can
                see within 60 feet of you. Machines, constructs, and vehicles
                within 30 feet of that point are subjected to EMP.
                Machines in the area cease to function for 1 minute.
                Constructs in the area with the Electronics feature must
                succeed on a Constitution saving throw or they are stunned
                until the end of your next turn. Vehicles in the area must
                succeed on a Constitution saving throw or their movement
                speed is reduced to 0 and they can’t take actions or reactions
                until the end of your next turn.
                Additionally, wireless and radio connections within a 100-
                foot-radius radius of the point are suppressed for 1 minute.

                As a bonus action, you target one machine
                you can see within 60 feet of you which doesn’t have active
                wireless capabilities. The device gains wireless capabilities
                with a radius of 100 feet for 1 minute.
                Alternatively, if EMP has affected a construct or vehicle, or
                has suppressed wireless capabilities for a machine, you can
                negate the effect for that target.
