                Beginning at 3rd level, you have streamlined and expanded
                your rites to swiftly apply them to your entire arsenal. When
                you activate your crimson rite, you can activate it for a
                number of weapons you are carrying equal to your
                proficiency bonus. You can choose which rite to apply to
                which weapon. Your rites do not end if you are carrying your
                weapon, even if you are no longer holding it.

                You also learn an additional Primal Rite, and access an
                additional Esoteric Rite at 15th level.

                If your rites cause an effect that requires a saving throw,
                the DC equals your hemocraft save DC.

                **Rite of the Flame.** A target hit by an attack with this
                weapon begins burning for 1 minute as if hit by a
                flamethrower. If you hit a target with this weapon that is
                already burning from this attack, you can instead cause
                another target within 10 feet of the original target to begin
                burning as if hit by this attack.

                minute. When a creature enters the area for the first time
                on a turn, or ends its turn there, it takes acid damage
                equal to one roll of your hemocraft die. A creature can
                take this damage no more than once per turn.

                Also at 7th level, when you take the Attack action, you can
                spend Hit Dice to magically reload special ammunition into
                firearms you are carrying before making an attack, causing
                any ammunition currently loaded in the firearms to fall to the
                ground at your feet. You can spend a number Hit Dice up to
                your proficiency bonus. You create an amount of cryo,
                incendiary, or shock ammunition (your choice what type of
                ammunition, including grenades or rockets) equal to the
                number you rolled, plus your Intelligence modifier for each
                Hit Dice spent. Ammunition created that exceeds the
                weapon's reload shot count is instead placed in a container
                you carry.

                Ammunition you create with this feature counts as magical
                for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
                nonmagical attacks and damage. The ammunition disappears

                At 11th level, you have learned how to break your rites,
                sundering the ritual for an instant of heightened power. On
                your turn, when you hit a creature with a firearm and
                damage it with your Crimson Rite feature, you can break the
                rite on the firearm, causing an additional effect based on the
                rite as detailed below.
                When you break a rite, such as the Rite of Flame, that
                specific rite disappears from any weapons affected by it at the
                end of your turn. You cannot activate a broken rite on any
                weapon until you finish a long rest.

                **Rite of the Flame.** You create a 5 foot wide line of fire
                between you and the target you hit, ending anywhere in
                the target’s space. Targets in this line must make a
                Dexterity saving throw. A target takes fire damage equal
                to four rolls of your hemocraft die on a failed save, or half
                as much damage on a successful one.

                At 11th level, you have learned how to break your rites,
                sundering the ritual for an instant of heightened power. On
                your turn, when you hit a creature with a firearm and
                damage it with your Crimson Rite feature, you can break the
                rite on the firearm, causing an additional effect based on the
                rite as detailed below.
                When you break a rite, such as the Rite of Flame, that
                specific rite disappears from any weapons affected by it at the
                end of your turn. You cannot activate a broken rite on any
                weapon until you finish a long rest.

                **Rite of the Frozen.** You create a 15 foot cube of frigid,
                swirling ice at a point of your choosing within the space of
                the target you hit for 1 minute. The area is difficult terrain
                and does not move with the target. A target that enters the
                area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there
                must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes
                cold damage equal to four rolls of your hemocraft die on a
                failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

                At 11th level, you have learned how to break your rites,
                sundering the ritual for an instant of heightened power. On
                your turn, when you hit a creature with a firearm and
                damage it with your Crimson Rite feature, you can break the
                rite on the firearm, causing an additional effect based on the
                rite as detailed below.
                When you break a rite, such as the Rite of Flame, that
                specific rite disappears from any weapons affected by it at the
                end of your turn. You cannot activate a broken rite on any
                weapon until you finish a long rest.

                **Rite of the Roar.** You create a 10-foot-radius sphere of
                blasting force at a point of your choosing within the space
                of the target you hit, followed by deafening silence. Each
                target in the sphere when it appears must make a
                Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target
                takes thunder damage equal to four rolls of your
                hemocraft die. Until the end of your next turn, the area is
                under the effect of the silence spell.

                it until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the

                At 18th level, you can call upon the remnants of munitions
                and rites past, allowing them to phase through opponents
                and obstacles. When you take the Attack action on your turn,
                you can make each of your ranged weapon attacks in the
                form of a 5-foot line until the end of your turn.
                The line is as long as your weapon's normal range, and you
                must make weapon attacks against each creature in the line
                individually. These attacks do not have disadvantage due to
                not being able to see the target, nor advantage due to the
                target not being able to see the attacker. The line extends
                through solid objects, ignoring cover.

                **Amplify.** You invoke one of your currently broken rites,
                allowing you to use the Break Rite feature on a single target
                you hit with a ranged weapon attack made while under the
                effects of this blood curse, as if the broken rite were activated
                on the weapon. Once you’ve amplified this blood curse, you
                must finish a long rest before you can amplify it again.
