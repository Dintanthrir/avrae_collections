                Once per turn, when you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher on
                your turn, you can cause one creature targeted by the spell to
                make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC.
                On a failed save, the target suffers one level of irradiated, to a
                maximum of level 3.
                Additionally, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you
                can spend 1 sorcery point to change that damage type to fire
                or radiant.

                As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up
                to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Immediately
                after you disappear, a wave of radiation spreads within a 10-
                foot-radius sphere centered on the space you left for 1
                minute. When a creature moves into the area for the first
                time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must
                make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC,
                taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much
                damage on a successful one.
                You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
                Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all
                expended uses when you finish a long rest.
