                As a reaction, when you or a willing creature
                within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or
                a saving throw, you and the willing creature can each choose
                to spend Hit Dice, up to a combined maximum of 4 Hit Dice.

                For each Hit Dice spent in this manner, the target adds 1d4
                to the result. You can only use this ability after the roll, but
                before any effects of the roll are applied.

                You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
                Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all
                expended uses when you finish a long rest.

                As an action, you present your holy symbol, choose up to
                six willing creatures (which can include yourself) within 30
                feet of you. Each creature can spend one or more Hit Dice to
                cause one other creature affected by this Channel Divinity to
                regain an equal amount of spent Hit Dice.
                Additionally, until the end of your next turn, each creature
                can spend a hit die on its turn (no action required) if it is not
                incapacitated. The creature rolls the Hit Dice and regains hit
                points equal to the die roll + the creature’s Constitution
                modifier + your cleric level.

                As a bonus action, you can magically create a nonliving
                object you’ve seen before in your empty hand or in an empty
                space within 5 feet of you. The object can be no larger than a
                3-foot cube and its credit value can’t be worth more than
                6,000 times your cleric level. The DM decides if a specific
                item can be created in this manner, and its value.

                The object vanishes after 1 hour unless you magically
                spend an amount of credits you’re carrying equal to its value
                when you use this Channel Divinity. The object cannot be
                used as the material component for a spell unless you spend
                credits for it in this manner first.

                You can liquidate your vast supply of divine
                Energy when you need it most. Once per turn, when you cast
                a spell on your turn that deals damage, you can expend one
                spell slot to deal additional damage to one target of the spell.
                The extra damage is 1d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for
                each spell level higher than the 1st, to a maximum of 4d8.

                Alternatively, once per turn, when you cast a spell on your
                turn that restores hit points, you can expend one spell slot to
                restore additional hit points to one target of the spell. The
                creature regains an extra 1d8 hit points for a 1st-level spell
                slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than the 1st, to a
