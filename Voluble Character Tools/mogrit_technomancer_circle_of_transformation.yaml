                While you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to
                expend one spell slot to increase your speed by 10 feet per level of the
                spell slot expended until the end of your current turn.

                The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into
                a variety of vehicles. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your
                Wild Shape to transform into a sentient vehicle with a
                challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 4. For
                example, at 2nd level, you can transform into a vehicle with a
                challenge rating of 1/2, such as a motorcycle or jet ski.

                When you transform, your vehicle form can have a melee
                weapon mount installed (you choose the type), per the
                vehicle modification (see Chapter 4). You can use your
                proficiency bonus instead of the vehicle's when making
                attacks with this weapon. You don't gain any of the vehicle's
                immunity to conditions.

                You ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table,
                but must abide by the other limitations there. All creatures
                are treated as the same size as you for the purposes of
                determining crashing damage. The DC for the Dexterity save
                to avoid being crashed into by you is equal to your spell save
                DC. If your form has an explosion effect when you are
                reduced to 0 hit points, you are not damaged by your
                explosion.

                Starting at 6th level, your attacks in vehicle form count as
                magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
                immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

                Additionally, when you transform into a Large or larger
                vehicle, you can have a ranged weapon mount installed with
                a gatling gun, assault cannon, or rocket launcher, per the
                vehicle modification. Ammunition for these weapons is
                magically created when you attack with them. You can use
                your proficiency bonus instead of the vehicle's when making
                attacks with these weapons.
